**Space Invaders for the Commodore VIC 20**
Start this game without any RAM expansions. 
I used the CBM PRG Studio if you plan to compile this game yourself go into the settings of the IDE and under BASIC Code Generation uncheck "include spaces" or else you will run out of memory.
Due to limited memory space I had to compress the code and write multiple commands into one line so I apologize if the code looks a bit messy i tried my best to keep it clean.
I also planned to add multiple levels but because I already ran out of memory I couldn't add them but either way I hope you can enjoy the game and/or learn from my code.
